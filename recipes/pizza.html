    <h2>Description</h2>

    <P>Start charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to medium-high heat.Combine 2 cups flour, 
        undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; 
        mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft 
        dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead on a floured 
        surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic but not sticky, 
        about 5 minutes.</P>
        <P>
      Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch 
      circles; they do not need to be perfect.Brush both sides of crust with additional oil. 
      Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until
       bottom is lightly browned and top looks set. Using long handled tongs, remove crust from 
       grill, grilled side up, to a platter or baking sheet.Carefully slide each pizza onto 
       the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom of crust is browned and
        cheese is melted. Remove from grill and serve immediately.
        </P>
